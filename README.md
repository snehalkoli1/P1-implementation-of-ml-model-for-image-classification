Image Classification Streamlit App

This repository contains a Streamlit application that allows users to classify images using a trained machine learning model.

**Key Features:**

- **Image Upload:** Users can upload an image file for classification.
- **Model Prediction:** The uploaded image is preprocessed and fed into the trained model for prediction.
- **Prediction Display:** The predicted class label and confidence score are displayed.
- **Optional: Visualization:** Visualizations like the model's architecture or a confusion matrix can be included to enhance understanding.

**Getting Started**

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/snehalkoli1/P1-implementation-of-ml-model-for-image-classification.git
   ```

This isolates your project's dependencies from your system's Python installation.
Use virtualenv or venv (Python 3.3+):
```
Bash
python3 -m venv venv
```
Activate the environment:

Linux/macOS: source venv/bin/activate
Windows: venv\Scripts\activate

Install dependencies:
```
Bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
Run the Streamlit app:
```
Bash
streamlit run app.py
```
Dependencies:

Streamlit
TensorFlow/PyTorch (or other deep learning framework for model development)
OpenCV (for image processing)
[List other required libraries, e.g., Pillow, NumPy]
Model:

The trained machine learning model is located in the models/ directory.
[Specify the type of model, e.g., Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)]
[Mention any specific details about the model, e.g., training dataset, accuracy]
